KnockedBack replaces traditional deaths from most damage types with a “knocked out” state, letting players and mobs deliver the final blow—or even rescue their allies—before true death occurs.

Lethal damage is canceled and the player is left at 1 HP in a helpless, immobile state for 20 seconds. While knocked you can’t move, sprint, jump, break blocks, attack, or interact. After those 20 seconds have passed, the player can move again and continue fighting. 

Living players can finish off (“execute”) a knocked target by pressing a key (default B) within range.

Execution takes 3 s.

Hostile or aggressive neutral mobs near a knocked player will automatically “grip” and execute them after 3 s, resetting if the mob is attacked first.

Mobs cannot execute players who are currently being carried. Press V near a knocked teammate to pick them up (they ride you), pausing their recovery timer. Executors (players or mobs) have their own movement/attack locked out during the 3 s delay. Any damage to a carrier drops their passenger and resumes that passenger’s recovery.

Fire, lava, fall, and explosion deaths bypass the knocked state and kill normally.

Animations and other stuff like config files and custom items for reviving will come in future updates.
